// We will not use a customized callback because we are using "passport" MW.
// The " passport~~~ " below is to process "send" authenticate response info to
//      google server, not back to the user.

// 1) 'google', the first argument defines that the strategy defined above
//      for the google strategis other than any other app.
// Therefore 'google' stands for containing the information about
//      Google's Strategy object. 

// 2) Google defines different properties for the auth.
//    'scope' defines the properties we want? to use for auth
//      ,among many different properties.
// In this app, we will use "profile" and "email" only.

// To auth after this app server receives the code from Google.
// Then after Google receives "code", it will exchange the code 
//      with the user profile. 
// Whever Google exchange "the code" with the user profile,
//      it produces "accessToken" which is generated by "callback"
//      of "Strategy" above.
